### Conventions

**COMMITS**
Commit is a snapshot of your code. To identify the commits made by you follow the convention below

`[COMMIT-TYPE] (T-X) / Commit Message`

Example:

1. With task assignment
   - `[LAYOUT] (T-1) / Added a horizontal spacing for better interface`

2. Without task assignment
   - `[DOCU] / Documentation for the project`

**PULL REQUESTS**
Pull request is the request you send to me in order for your code to be added in the main codebase. Follow the convention for me to see that you did your code and check it for any errors.

`[Name] (Close T-X) / Message`

Example:

`[Rence] (Close T-1) / Login Page`

STEPS:

1. ALWAYS set me as a reviewer
2. Follow the convention
3. Wait for review
4. Update your codebase
